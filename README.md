Oh man, it looks like the Wuhan Institute of Virology scrubbed all their web pages in late 2020, only if someone had archived every link and email that existed on their site.

I've investigated and collected evidence via OSINT and other research methods on the origins of COVID-19 since March, 2020, when I looked at the evidence and the actions of the Chinese government and knew they were going to go in full cover-up mode, I archived everything.

## Smoking Gun Evidence
I archived the most relevant/compelling evidence found on the WIV's website on archive.org, please see this Reddit thread for more information:

Everything obtained here was obtained legally through what's called PASSIVE reconaissance, which harvests information from the internet without ever making a direct connection to the target machine.
